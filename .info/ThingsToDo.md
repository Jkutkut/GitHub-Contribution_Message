# ThingsToDo:
- [ ] Define basic font:
  - [ ] JSON? -> This will enable custom fonts.
  - [ ] Instead of binary options (committed or not), let fonts have intensity variations (more or less commits)
  - [ ] Create a simple HTML to easily create the JSON for new fonts (already WIP ;) )
- [ ] Select language:
  - [ ] Python?
  - [ ] Shell?
- [ ] Define logic
- [ ] Create custom files (or a custom README.md) to give credit this Github Repository


# Ideas:
- [ ] Script to move all commits of user to non visible date (to hide them).
