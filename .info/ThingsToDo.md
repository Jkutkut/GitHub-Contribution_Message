# ThingsToDo:
- [ ] Define basic font:
  - [x] JSON? -> This will enable custom fonts.
  - [ ] Instead of binary options (committed or not), let fonts have intensity variations (more or less commits)
  - [X] Create a simple HTML to easily create the JSON for new fonts
- [x] Select language:
  - [x] Python and Shell for the use of the font
  - [x] Web for the creation of the fonts
- [ ] Define logic
- [ ] Create custom files (or a custom README.md) to give credit this Github Repository


# Ideas:
- [ ] Script to move all commits of user to non visible date (to hide them).
- [ ] Web:
  - [ ] Have 3 modes:
    - [ ] Free mode (to draw custom shapes, current)
    - [ ] Text mode (using a given font)
      - [ ] While the text is inputed, the drawing is updated
    - [ ] Font creation mode.
      - [ ] Multiple drawing menus (one for each character)
      - [ ] Able to create a font from scratch (like [this file](./fonts/../../fonts/py_basic_font.json))
      - [ ] Edit/modify fonts (to modify a already created one)?
  - [ ] Be able to change the intensity of a pixel using the mouse wheel.
  - [ ] Have a copy button next to the generated output to copy to clipboard.
